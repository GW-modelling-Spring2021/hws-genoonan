Good start on this!

1. You are right that the response is similar ... just be a bit more specific
about WHY the well leads to this flow distribution.

2. You are on a good track.  Try thinking holistically about how flow is
occurring to/into/from the well and rework your answer slightly.  For
example ... is water getting backed up anywhere?

3. Good answer!  Combine this with #2 to intuit what is happening just outside of the
capture zone, directly downgradient from the well.

4. This is partially correct.  Just explain WHY the boundaries impact the drawdown. In
answer to your question, for a confined aquifer the gradient does NOT impact the
drawdown.  But, there is one more thing.  Right near the well the drawdown should be
circular.  Why isn't it on your plot??

5. Good thinking on the boundary fluxes.  Can you think of a way to compare the results
for the centered and non-centered wells QUANTITATIVELY?  Good that you caught the
'flip'.  To answer this, think about how matrix rows are defined in python versus
MODFLOW.  Keep this in mind if you make your own plots (not using the built-in FloPy
utilties)!

BTW ... I love your keg of beer analogy!  But, a straw!  Sounds like a recipe for a
hangover.
