Excellent work ... 100%!  The 1D flow representation in MODFLOW for the mounding
case is confusing.  Don't worry too much about it.  The point is just that
by defining a single layer there is really no way for the model to represent
vertical flow.  Flow enters the tops of the cells as recharge, vertically.  But,
flow between cells is calculated node to node ... all of the nodes lie in a
plane!  Good work on the well mass balance, too.  It isn't a simple problem.
You have the right idea for calculating the recharge that is captured.
Remember that the well is pumping at 8 m3/d ... so, you can calculate the flow
into the boundary by differencing.  Alternatively, you need to plot the flow
rate (consistent units, m3/d) versus y location and estimate the length of the
boundary that is captured.  You can then sum the inflow over that area.  Does
all of this make sense?  If not ... please ask for clarification in class today!!
